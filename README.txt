The patient can upload a prescription by selecting any of the given category and the details are uploaded to the database.
By using a realtime database, even the doctor can directly upload the prescription on the database and the details need not be uploaded again by the patient.
The patient records can be viewed on the app. Each category is separated and medicines under each category can be viewed differently.
The patient can set an alarm as a reminder on when they need to take medicines. Along with alarm, an SMS is also sent to alert the patient.
This application is a part of SMART HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. The details of the patient can be made digital and there would be no need to carry prescriptions as now both the doctor and patient can access and view from the database.
